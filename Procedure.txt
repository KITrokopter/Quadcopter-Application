Startprocedure for Quadcopter-applications

Starting roscore
Starting a master-node "master". The master-application will make the decision which application connects with which quadcopter
Starting other nodes "nodes". Each will start with a unique ID (alternative: generate a unique ID, but the master shouldn't worry about the uniqueness of each application-ID)
The nodes will ask the master to be put in the list of running node-applications (a Service).
The master will find the URIs (somehow) and call each node to open a link to one quadcopter (another Service) 
The nodes (and probably the master too) will be Subscribers to the controll-messages (the topic, respectively).
